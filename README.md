# Roweather

A mobile weather application targeted towards rowers in Cambridge

## Description

Roweather is a weather application designed for iOS and Android systems which is targeted towards river users in Cambridge - and rowers in particular. It is designed in order to exemplify the paradigm of User-Centred Design, and as such, we, the designers, have aimed to keep the user in mind at all stages of the process. 

Throughout this process, we have sought to include features important to our target market which are not typically found on other weather apps. For instance, on the home page, the key piece of information included on each day is the CUCBC daily flag rating, as this is considered vital for planning whether to set outings for certain days, and for those that are set, to embark on them. Other important included pieces of information are water level, current speed and wind speed.

In addition, we have built the capabilities to book outings for certain dates and times, and included a number of settings on another page so the user can customise how the app functions.

## How to run

Our source code can be run from any computer with Flutter/Dart installed, regardless of whether it's a Windows, Mac or Linux computer. It will, however, also require the Android studio sdk to run.

## Libraries used

We made frequent use of Flutter libraries in our project:

carousel_slider - In order to display the carousels used in the homepage to display different dates.

cupertino_icons - To make use of a number of easily recognisable icons so that the user is not left in any ambiguity over what to do.

flutter_svg - To be able to format and display the icons mentioned above

http - To fetch any new weather data from the internet.

table_calendar - In order to import the interactive calendar used to select dates on the booking page.
