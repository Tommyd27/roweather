# Roweather

A mobile weather application targeted towards rowers in Cambridge

## Description

Roweather is a weather application designed for iOS and Android systems which is targeted towards river users in Cambridge - and rowers in particular. It is designed in order to exemplify the paradigm of User-Centred Design, and as such, we, the designers, have aimed to keep the user in mind at all stages of the process. 

Throughout this process, we have sought to include features important to our target market which are not typically found on other weather apps. For instance, on the home page, the key piece of information included on each day is the CUCBC daily flag rating, as this is considered vital for planning whether to set outings for certain days, and for those that are set, to embark on them. Other important included pieces of information are water level, current speed and wind speed.

In addition, we have built the capabilities to book outings for certain dates and times, and included a number of settings on another page so the user can customise how the app functions.
